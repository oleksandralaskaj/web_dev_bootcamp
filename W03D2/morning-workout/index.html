<h1>Seats rearrangement</h1>
<p>The seats are numbered with whole numbers and the seat number is printed on each ticket.
    Over time the theatre officials have noticed that visitors have often a hard time finding their seats. They decided
    to change the numbering from whole numbers to row and column where rows are numbered with letters. For example, seat
    number 27 will be identified as C7.
    Write a web application to help convert the seat numbers to row and column.
    The user will enter a seat number such as 14 in a prompt and the website will display the column and row such as B4
    as an alert.</p>
