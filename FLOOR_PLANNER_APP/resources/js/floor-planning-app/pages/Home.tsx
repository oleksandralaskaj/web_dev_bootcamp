                <p className={styles.paragraph}>Floor Planner emerged from my desire to bridge the gap for
                    non-professionals
                    seeking an intuitive floor plan tool. As a junior developer, I empathized with real estate agents
                    and
                    homeowners struggling to visualize spaces. Inspired by their challenges, I embarked on a mission to
                    create a user-friendly solution.

                    Leveraging React, Typescript, and Laravel, Floor Planner was born—a
                    platform that simplifies floor plan creation. With its drag-and-drop interface, users can sketch
                    rooms,
                    add doors, windows, and even resize elements. Whether you’re planning your dream home or preparing a
                    property listing, Floor Planner empowers everyone to design with confidence.
